## Tech
- **Flutter (Dart)**
- **Riverpod** for state management
- **SharedPreferences** as local persistence (fake backend)
- **Font Awesome** for icons
- Simple theming system (light/dark)
- **Clean architecture**, **feature-based folder structure**
    - Clear separation of **data**, **domain**, and **presentation (UI)** layers
    - Each feature (e.g., Fridge) organized as an independent module with its own models, logic, and UI

---

## GitHub workflow
- Work split into feature branches
- Pull requests used for merging
- Clear history of incremental changes

Includes a simple **GitHub Actions** workflow (**Flutter CI**) that runs on each push/PR:
- installs Flutter
- fetches dependencies
- runs `flutter analyze`
- checks formatting with `dart format --set-exit-if-changed .`

This keeps the repo clean and consistent.
