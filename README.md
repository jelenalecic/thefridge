# TheFridge

Flutter application for tracking items stored in a fridge.  
Built as part of the Hylastix candidate test.

## What it does
- Keeps track of items by added date and best-before date
- Displays items by category with icons
- Supports filtering and sorting (e.g. expiring soon, expired, fresh)
- Shows item details in a clean UI

Focus was on the **frontend** â€“ Flutter with Riverpod for state management.
